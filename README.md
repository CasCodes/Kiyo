### Tired of reading long web pages?

Kiyo can help! By using state-of-the-art machine learning (nlp), Kiyo summarizes the text for you! Just like that:

### How it works
The extensions reads the text you've highlighted and sends it to a REST API (Build with API Gateway). This invokes a serverless Lambda function which itself invokes a machine learning endpoint deployed on sagemaker. There the summarization is predicted and the result gets send back to your browser.

If you want to learn more, have a look at my [blog post]()

### Install
1. Download the packed extension
2. Navigate to the extensions setting in your chromium browser. (You should see an overview of all installed)
3. Drag and drop the `KiyoExtension.crx` file into the browser. (You may need to enable developer mode)

✅ That's it! Kiyo will be visible in the extensions menu in the top right.
 
> Info: Chrome recently switched their extensions to v3, which can't yet be ported to firefox. I will try to do that as soon as possible.
